        I have a confession... you probably already know that I have a confession based on the title. My confessions is that I stole your dog. Just kidding, I did not steal your dog. The real confession is that I have had a massive crush on you since last year. (I've been too afraid to let you know)
        <br><br>I would like to ask you to homecoming, however, I have no idea on whether or not you are already planning on going with people nor if you even like me (you probably don't but it'd be worth knowing before you graduate). I am being deliberate in not typing how I usually would type
        just so you won't potentially realize who I am without playing a game. (Even though you are definitively going to say no to homecoming, I definitely want you to know who I and how I feel about you...)
        <br><br>Please play through the game ^_^
